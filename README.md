# artifactsmmo-client

Generated Go Client based upon <https://docs.artifactsmmo.com/api_guide/openapi_spec>

## Usage as Go Client

You can use `/client` as a generated API Client for your own projects.

I downgraded the OpenAPI spec to 3.0 in order to use <https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2> for a cleaner client.
