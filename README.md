# artifactsmmo-cli

Go based CLI for https://artifactsmmo.com/

## Usage as CLI

Don't use this.

## Usage as Go Client

You can use `/client` as a generated API Client for your own projects. I downgraded the OpenAPI spec to 3.0 in order to 
use https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2 for a cleaner client.
